(mostly quoted from "features_info.txt" that comes with the original data set)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables in the output data set, after running the analysis script, represent the average of the measurments from the original data set grouped by the subject and activity 

For example, in the below table *tBodyAcc.mean.X* represents the mean accelerometer value along the X-axis for subject 1's walking activity and *tBodyAcc.std.X* represents the mean of the standard deviation X-axis acceleration values.

| subject | activity | tBodyAcc.mean.X | tBodyAcc.std.X |
| ----    | ----     |  ----           |    -----       |
| 1	| WALKING	| 0.2773308	|	-0.283740259 |

All other variables in the output data set follow the same pattern
